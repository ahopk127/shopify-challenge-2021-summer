# Image Repository

This program is a repository that stores image files.

## Usage

When you start the program up (using the jar in the root of the project directory), you will be prompted for a directory.  This is the repository directory; choose a new directory if you have not created a repository before.

You will then see a list of public images on the left.  If you select one image, it will appear on the right.  You can also select multiple images, but they will not appear on the right.

Use the button on the top-right to log on or create a user account.  Register by "logging on" with a new username (one that does not already have an account).

Use either add button to add an image to the repository.  You will be prompted for one or more image files to add.  Private images are visible by only you, while public images are visible by everyone (including users that are not logged in).

Use the remove button to remove the selected image(s) from the repository.  You can only remove an image that you added.

Use the save button to save the selected image(s) to another folder (you will be prompted for this folder).
